# Pico-UF2-Uploader-Mac
Easily upload UF2 files to your Raspberry Pi Pico

Instructions for use:

No installation needed - Just unzip folder and then you can drag the app into your Applications folder.

1. The Pico MUST be in Mass Storage Mode in order to transfer a UF2 file onto it.  To do this, press and hold the BOOTSEL button and then plug the Pico into your Mac. Then release the BOOTSEL button.
2. If you already have the app open, click on the refresh button at the top right corner.  A green dot indicates that the Pico is detected.  If there is s red dot, disconnect the Pico and then try again.
3. To upload a UF2 file to the Pico board, you must first click on the button to locate the UF2 file.
4. Once the UF2 file has been located, you will be able to see the location of the file in the box.  To use a different UF2 file, just repeat the process.
5. To upload the file to the Pico, click on the button.  If the upload was successful, the Pico will be ejected (don't worry about the message!) and the app will show a confirmation box.

To upload another file, follow the process again to put the Pico in Mass Storage Mode and then click on the refresh button to check that the Pico is detected.
